                <p class="par">Dear Jai,</p>
                <p class="par">Today, on your birthday, I wanted to let you know just how important you are to me. It is my greatest joy of my life to be your best friend. Your friendship means more to me than you can ever know. There was nothing like you who had my back. Our friendship has kept me strong and resilient. And thru ups and downs, always remember that I will always be there for you. If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm one chat away or even call. Willing to listen to you. Oh, how I wish that I want to be with you in your special day. 
                    But due to the ongoing pandemic, this is the only thing that I can do for you for now. Happy Birthday again Jai, Love you always and miss you. Hope to see you soon <3 </p>
